This directory contains datasets that have been generated from the electronic structure calculations. It is divided in directories depending on the level of theory at which the data has been calculated.

## PBE_B3LYP

### pbe_b3lyp_Q_test_abs.csv

Since it was noticed that when training with the datased tot-pbe-b3lyp.csv, the neural network worked better than with pbe_b3lyp_partQ.csv, I looked into what were the differences between the two datasets. The only one that I could find was the ordering of the samples (which is strange, because it should not make a difference). But just to test, I made a new data set with the same structure as pbe_b3lyp_partQ.csv, but with the ordering of tot-pbe-b3lyp.csv to see if this makes a difference to the training. The energies are kept absolute.The energies are in Ha
